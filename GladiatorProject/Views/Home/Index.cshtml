                    <p>Damage dice show how many of what type of dice you roll to determine your damage.</p>
                    <p>Strenght will increase strenght modifyer that help increase both damage and hit chance.</p>
                    <p>Strenght modifyer is calculated "(Strenght - 10) / 2" and this is what is added onto damage and hit rolls.</p>
